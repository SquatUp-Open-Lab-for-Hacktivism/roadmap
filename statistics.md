* [Rates of self-employment between locals and newcomers is aprox. the same](https://books.google.de/books?id=xAGpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=refugee+market+self+employment+europe&source=bl&ots=M3aLi_aJSc&sig=IQKcU28goJYL0cRDuD_5MHsmWHA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMioj7l5fNAhUnJ8AKHc4NBd4Q6AEIZDAI#v=onepage&q=refugee%20market%20self%20employment%20europe&f=false)
* [allowance to be self-employed depends a residence permit being granted](http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/Germany/reception-conditions/employment-education/access-labour-market#footnoteref3_xf0pfbm)
* [Paragraph 3.15 says self employment is in general an option](http://website-pace.net/documents/19863/168397/20140313-RefugeeRightToWork-EN.pdf/8f426c61-f2ba-439a-b7db-7c2c585a2fe7)
* [The EU wants to encourage self employment](http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.news.38456)
  * and [HERE](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=952&langId=en)
* [The rate of self employment in germany is 11.2%](https://data.oecd.org/emp/self-employment-rate.htm) but that doesnt take into account the worldwide trend to push self employment... ...and it's measured relative to employed people over 15 years
In general, germany has according to wikipedia [~53 million employed people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Germany) and again according to wikipedia [~81 million population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany). So that's 5.83 million self employed.
If the rates will long term follow the usual pattern then, from [**~1.5 million refugees**](http://www.ibtimes.com/europes-refugee-crisis-germany-registered-over-1-million-asylum-seekers-2015-2251590) - following the same pattern would mean potentially 0.98 million employed and 0.1 in self employment, that's roughly **100.000** of all **newcomers in germany** will be **self employed** in the future
* [This article](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/start-ups-fluechtlingskinder-mischen-deutschland-auf-a-1028973.html) says that migrants are more often self employed than germans
  * => means eventually there will be more than 100.000 newcomers self employed in germany alone - ...and even way more given the general trend for more self employment
* [Statistics about newcomers otherwise are generally missing](http://www.svr-migration.de/presse/presse-forschung/was-wir-ueber-fluechtlinge-nicht-wissen/) - but it's something the app could offer to provide to get refugee centers on board :smile: ..by giving them an opportunity to get part of that data for them
* [Here are the new arrivals in 2016](http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php), so every year germany will take 500k more refugees for at least the next several years
  * other countries might do similar stuff, but for the amount of **self employed newcomers in germany each year** it means: **+35.000**
