# Mission
**SquatUp** transparently helps newcomers into self employment. We are an informal collective of people with projects who want to build tools & services that create and connect into a vibrant ecosystem in which entrepreneurial newcomers can strive & transparently start & maintain their self employment - whether that means freelancing or creating their own businesses. We are dedicated to co-create a more transparent society in a spirit of radical generosity. We warmly welcome you and invite you to help and/or join us with your project :-)


# Contributors
We come from different walks of life and bootstrap everything we do.

## How can you participate?
Currently we are dedicated to projects you can find [here](https://waffle.io/SquatUp/roadmap).
You can involve yourself as much as you can afford by either joining one of our existing projects or by creating your own project and connect it to our mission. **Just drop us a message and we can brainstorm how to make that happen :-)**
