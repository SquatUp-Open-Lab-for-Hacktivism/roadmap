# Mission
**SquatUp** transparently helps newcomers into self employment. We are an informal collective of people with projects who want to build tools & services that create and connect into a vibrant ecosystem in which entrepreneurial newcomers can strive & transparently start & maintain their self employment - whether that means freelancing or creating their own businesses. We are dedicated to co-create a more transparent society in a spirit of radical generosity. We warmly welcome you and invite you to help and/or join us with your project :-)

## Our focus:
* self-employment, 
* transparency, 
* transition of know-how between newcomers starting their business and 
* connection with local supporters (non-profits, incubators etc. and businesses).

# Some of the projects we built and maintain:

**[Wizard Amigos Institute] (https://github.com/wizardamigosinstitute)**

**[eSova] (http://app.esova.rs/)**
We also work on a platform that we built for the city of Sabac in Serbia in order to reduce high youth unemployment. eSova it's an e-learning platform with educational videos for teaching programming. 

**[RefugeesWork] (http://www.refugeeswork.com/)**
