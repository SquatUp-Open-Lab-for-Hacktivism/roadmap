# Mission
**SquatUp** transparently helps newcomers into self employment. We are an informal collective of people with projects who want to build tools & services that create and connect into a vibrant ecosystem in which entrepreneurial newcomers can strive & transparently start & maintain their self employment - whether that means freelancing or creating their own businesses. We are dedicated to co-create a more transparent society in a spirit of radical generosity. We warmly welcome you and invite you to help and/or join us with your project :-)

## Our focus:
* self-employment, 
* transparency, 
* transition of know-how between newcomers starting their business and 
* connection with local supporters (non-profits, incubators etc. and businesses).

# Contributors
We come from different walks of life and bootstrap everything we do.
Every Friday we meet online to coordinate our work on the projects. **Feel free to join :-)** We of course also organise local hacking days (next one: TBA).

## How can you participate?
Currently we are dedicated to projects you can find [here](https://waffle.io/SquatUp/roadmap).
You can involve yourself as much as you can afford by either joining one of our existing projects or by creating your own project and connect it to our mission. **Just drop us a message and we can brainstorm how to make that happen :-)**
