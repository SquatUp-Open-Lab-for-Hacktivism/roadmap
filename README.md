# Mission

**SquatUp** is a network of collectives/projects with a shared vision to build an autonomous ecosystem in which entrepreneurial newcomers can strive and start their self employment - whether that means freelancing or creating their own businesses.

We come from different walks of life and bootstrap everything we do. We are dedicated to co-create a more transparent society in a spirit of radical generosity. We warmly welcome you and invite you to join us with your project :-)

Every Friday we meet online to coordinate our work on the projects. **Feel free to join :-)**

## How can you participate?

Currently we are dedicated to projects you can find [here] (https://waffle.io/SquatUp-Open-Lab-for-Hacktivism/roadmap).
You can involve yourself as much as you can afford by either joining one of the projects of our people or by creating your own project with shared mission. If you have an idea about how you could help that is not listed yet - just drop us a message and we can brainstorm how to make that happen.
