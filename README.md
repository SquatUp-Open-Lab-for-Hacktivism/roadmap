# Mission

**SquatUp** is an informal collective of people with projects who want to build tools and services that create and connect into a vibrant ecosystem in which entrepreneurial newcomers can strive and start their self employment - whether that means freelancing or creating their own businesses.

## What can you help us with?

We will start posting all kinds of projects that people need support with.
You can involve yourself as much as you can afford by either creating your own project centered around our mission and connecting it with existing projects or joining one of the projects of our people :-) If you have an idea about how you could help that is not listed yet - just drop us a message and we can brainstorm how to make that happen.
